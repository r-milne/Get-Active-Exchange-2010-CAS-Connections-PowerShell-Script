.DESCRIPTION

Script was initially created to easily show the number of connected users to each Exchange 2010 CAS. 
    
This was due to inequitable Load Balancer disctribution, and needed a way to quickly report on how Exchange saw the traffic, and how the traffic was distributed. 
 
Script will report to the screen the number of connectionss.  If required you can modify to output to a  CSV using standard methods. 

Uses Write-Progress to indicate the duration taken. 

Note that for EAS there is the requests/sec counter that is used. 

 

.ASSUMPTIONS

Script is being executed with sufficient permissions to retrieve perfmon counters on the server(s) targeted.

You can live with the Write-Host cmdlets :)

You can add your error handling if you need it.
