.SYNOPSIS
	Purpose of this script is to report on  particular performance monitor counters for Outlook RPC Client Access, OWA and Exchange ActiveSync on multiple servers

.DESCRIPTION
	Script was initially created to easily show the number of connected users to each Exchange 2010 CAS. 
    
    This was due to inequitable Load Balancer disctribution, and needed a way to quickly report on how Exchange saw the traffic, and how the traffic was distributed.  
	
	Script will report to the screen the number of connections.  If required you can modify to output to a  CSV using standard methods.  

    Uses Write-Progress to indicate the duration taken.  

    Note that for EAS there is the requests/sec counter that is used.  

    Note that the counters are reversed for POP and IMAP for some reason....
    IMAP is "Current Connections"
    POP  is "Connections Current"

    If the IMAP and POP services are not running, script should continue.  The values reported will be zero.  



.ASSUMPTIONS
	Script is being executed with sufficient permissions to retrieve perfmon counters on the server(s) targeted. 

	You can live with the Write-Host cmdlets :) 

	You can add your error handling if you need it.   

	

.VERSION
  
	2.0  	4-12-2014 -- Initial script released to the scripting gallery 
	3.0	20-1-2015 -- Added POP & IMAP Counters due to customer feedback
	4.0	11-8-2015 -- Edited to remove warnings/errors if POP or IMAP not enabled
	5.0 	4-10-2016 -- Added EWS and Web Services counters for Adam as he was too lazy to do it himself.  Added Blurb to output to explain counters a little. 
	6.0	20-2-2019 -- Added Outlook Anywhere counters -- requested by Bruce from the Peg.

# Script was intended to dynamically query for Exchange CAS 2010 servers.  The server input can be altered to suit your particular taste and/or requirements
# For example the below line can be remmed out, and you can use Import-CSV or Get-Content to feed in a list of names.....
#
# An example of Get-Content would be:
# $ExchangeServers = Get-Content  "C:\Scripts\ServerList.txt"

# The blurb is displayed to provide a precis of each reported value 
$Blurb = "Counters retrieved are: `n`tRPC  = RPC Client Access Connections `n`tOA   = Current Unique Outlook Anywhere users `n`tOWA  = Current Unique OWA users `n`tEAS  = EAS Requests/Sec `n`tIMAP = IMAP Total Connections  `n`tPOP  = POP Connections Current `n`tWSR  = Exchange Web Services Requests/Sec `n`tWST  = Web Service (IIS) Total Current Connections `n"

# All Exchange servers in the organisation are returned, sorted to meet my OCD personality issues and the Name property is then pipe to the ForEach-Obect to render it to a string
# This allows the input to be easily swapped to a CSV, TXT file or just a list of servers in a string.....


# Declare an empty array to hold the output
$Output = @()

# Declare a custom PS object. This is the template that will be copied multiple times. 
# This is used to allow easy manipulation of data from potentially different sources

# Get a list of Exchange 2010 CAS servers.  Sort this based on name to meet my OCD requirements...
# Can easily edit the query.
